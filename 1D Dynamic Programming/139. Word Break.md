```python
        wordSet = set(wordDict)

```
- This will delete duplicate dictionary entries automatically. 

```python
            if not s:
                return True
```
- Checks base case which means if the string is empty. 

```python
            for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
                if s[:i] in wordSet:
                    if canBreak(s[i:]):
                        memo[s] = True
                        return True
            memo[s] = False
            return False
```

### <span style="color: red;">Why are we starting with 1 in for i in range(1, len(s) + 1): </span>

- Because if we hadn't then when it goes in the if loop
- It would have resulted in an infinite loop because this s[:i] would have meant
- starting from 0th index until and not including the 0th index. 

Yes.

When `i == 1`, the slice `s[:i]` means: start at index 0 (default) and take characters up to but not including index `1`. So you get exactly the first character (`s[0]`).

More generally:
- `s[:i]` produces the prefix of length `i` (indices `0` through `i-1`).
- The loop `for i in range(1, len(s) + 1)` tries every non‑empty prefix.
- Starting at `1` skips the empty string (`s[:0]`), ensuring progress.

Example: if `s = "cats"`  
i=1 → `s[:1] == "c"`  
i=2 → `s[:2] == "ca"`  
i=3 → `s[:3] == "cat"`  
i=4 → `s[:4] == "cats"`
