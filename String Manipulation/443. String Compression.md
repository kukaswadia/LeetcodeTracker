**Initialize Variables:**
```python
n = len(chars)
read = 0
write = 0
```
- `n`: stores the original array length
- `read`: pointer to scan through the array
- `write`: pointer to write compressed data in-place

**Main Loop:**
```python
while read < n:
    ch = chars[read]
    count = 0
```
- Continue until we've read all characters
- `ch`: stores the current character we're counting
- `count`: tracks how many consecutive occurrences
- The line ch = chars[read] is storing the current character at the read position into the variable ch.
  chars[read] accesses the character at index read in the input array
  ch becomes a reference to this character that we want to count consecutive occurrences of
- 
**Count Consecutive Characters:**
```python
while read < n and chars[read] == ch:
    read += 1
    count += 1
```
- Advance `read` pointer while the character matches `ch`
- Increment `count` for each occurrence

**Write Character:**
```python
chars[write] = ch
write += 1
```
- Write the character to the current write position
- Move write pointer forward

The line `chars[write] = ch` is writing the current character to the compressed array at the `write` position.

**Purpose:**
- Takes the character stored in `ch` (the character we just finished counting)
- Places it at index `write` in the `chars` array
- This overwrites the original array in-place with the compressed version

**Example:**
If we're compressing `["a","a","b","b","c"]`:
- After counting two "a"s, `ch = "a"` and `write = 0`
- `chars[write] = ch` writes "a" at position 0
- The next line `write += 1` moves the write pointer to position 1
- Then the count "2" would be written at position 1

This is part of the in-place compression - we're building the compressed result directly in the original array, using the `write` pointer to track where to place each compressed element.

**Write Count (if > 1):**
```python
if count > 1:
    for digit in str(count):
        chars[write] = digit
        write += 1
```
- Only write count if more than 1 occurrence
- Convert count to string and write each digit separately
- Example: count=12 writes '1', then '2'

These two lines are converting the count to a string and writing each digit individually to the compressed array.

**Line 1: `for digit in str(count):`**
- Converts the integer `count` to a string using `str(count)`
- Iterates through each character (digit) in that string
- Example: if `count = 12`, then `str(count) = "12"`, and the loop iterates over `"1"` and `"2"`

**Line 2: `chars[write] = digit`**
- Writes each digit character to the array at the current `write` position
- Each digit is treated as a separate character in the compressed array

**Example:**
If `count = 12` and `write = 3`:
- First iteration: `digit = "1"`, `chars[3] = "1"`
- Second iteration: `digit = "2"`, `chars[4] = "2"`

This is necessary because the problem requires multi-digit counts to be stored as individual characters. So a count of 12 becomes two separate array elements: `"1"` and `"2"`, not a single integer `12`.compresses `["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]` to `["a","2","b","2","c","3"]` with length 6.
