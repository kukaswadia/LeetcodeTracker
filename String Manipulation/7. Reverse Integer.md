This module contains a solution for reversing an integer while handling various edge cases.

---

## Class: Solution

The `Solution` class provides a method to reverse an integer.

### Method: reverseString

#### Initial Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1

        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

## Issues in the Code:

1. **`x` is an Integer, Not a List**:
   - The input `x` is an integer, but the code treats it as if it were a list (e.g., `len(x)` and `x[left], x[right]` are invalid for integers).

2. **Invalid Check for `left`**:
   - `if left is not int:` is invalid. `left` is an integer, and this check doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The swapping logic (`x[left], x[right] = x[right], x[left]`) is not applicable to integers. Integers are immutable, so you cannot directly swap their digits like you would with a list.

4. **No Handling of Overflow**:
   - The problem specifies that the reversed integer must fit within the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`. This is not handled in the code.

5. **No Handling of Negative Numbers**:
   - The code does not account for the possibility of `x` being negative.

## Explanation of the Fixes:

### 1. Handle the Sign:
- Use a variable `sign` to store whether the input is negative or positive.
- Work with the absolute value of `x` to simplify the reversal process.
- The `abs()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the non-negative value of a number, effectively removing any negative sign. For example, if `x` is `-5`, `abs(x)` will return `5`.

### 2. Reverse the Digits:
- Use a `while` loop to extract the last digit of `x` (`x % 10`) and append it to `reversed_x`.
- **Explanation of Steps**:
  - **Extracting the Last Digit**: The modulo operator (`x % 10`) returns the remainder of the division of one number by another. For example, if `x = 123`, then `x % 10` evaluates to `3`, which is the last digit of `123`.
  - **Multiplying by 10**: The operation `reversed_x * 10` shifts all the digits of `reversed_x` one place to the left. For example, if `reversed_x` is `12`, multiplying it by `10` results in `120`, creating space for a new digit at the end.
  - **Adding the Digit**: The `+ digit` part appends the newly extracted digit to the end of `reversed_x`. For instance, if `digit` is `3` and `reversed_x` was `120`, the result becomes `123`.
  - **Removing the Last Digit**: Use integer division (`x //= 10`) to remove the last digit from `x`.

#### Example:
If the original number is `123`, the process would look like this:
1. Start with `reversed_x = 0`.
2. Extract `digit = 3` → `reversed_x = 0 * 10 + 3 = 3`.
3. Extract `digit = 2` → `reversed_x = 3 * 10 + 2 = 32`.
4. Extract `digit = 1` → `reversed_x = 32 * 10 + 1 = 321`.

### 3. Check for Overflow:
- After reversing, check if the result is within the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`. If not, return `0`.

### 4. Restore the Sign:
- Multiply the reversed number by `sign` to restore its original sign.

## Example Walkthrough:

### Input:
`x = 123`

### Execution:


1

. **Initialization**:
   - `sign = 1`, `x = 123`
2. **Reverse Digits**:
   - Extract `digit = 3`, `reversed_x = 3`, `x = 12`
   - Extract `digit = 2`, `reversed_x = 32`, `x = 1`
   - Extract `digit = 1`, `reversed_x = 321`, `x = 0`
3. **Restore Sign**:
   - `reversed_x = 321`
4. **Check Overflow**:
   - `321` is within range.
5. **Return**:
   - Output: `321`

## Summary:
- Extract the last digit and store it in `reversed_x`.
- Shift `reversed_x` left to make space for the last digit, then add it.
- Remove the last digit from `x` and repeat until all digits are processed.
- Handle edge cases like overflow and negative numbers.
