# Understanding String Immutability in Python

In Python, **strings are immutable**, meaning that once a string is created, its characters cannot be changed or modified directly. If you try to assign a value to a specific index of a string (e.g., `s[0] = 'x'`), Python will raise a `TypeError`.

### Example:
```python
s = "hello"
s[0] = 'H'  # This will raise an error because strings are immutable.
```

---

### Problematic Code:
For this piece of code:
```python
left[word], right[word] = right[word], left[word]
```

This line attempts to modify specific characters in the string `s` by swapping them. However, since `s` is a string, you cannot modify it directly like this. Instead, you need to convert the string into a **mutable data structure**, such as a list, which allows modifications.

---

### Solution:
To work around string immutability, you can:

1. Convert the string to a list using `list(s)`.
2. Perform the modifications (e.g., swapping characters).
3. Convert the list back to a string using `"".join(list)`.

### Example Solution:
```python
s = "hello"
s_list = list(s)  # Convert string to list: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
s_list[0], s_list[4] = s_list[4], s_list[0]  # Swap characters
s = "".join(s_list)  # Convert back to string: "oellh"
```

This approach ensures that you can modify the characters while respecting Python's immutability rules for strings.
