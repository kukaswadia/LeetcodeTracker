- If the start time of the current interval (start) is less than end, it means the current interval overlaps with the previous one, so we increment the remove counter.
- Otherwise, update end to the end time of the current interval. 


- tracks the end time of the last non-overlapping interval. 

        intervals.sort(key = lambda x : x[1])
The intervals are sorted by their ending times (x[1]). Sorting by the end time is a common greedy strategy for interval problems, as it helps minimize overlap.



end: Tracks the end time of the last non-overlapping interval. Initially, it is set to the start time of the first interval (intervals[0][0]).

start = times[0]: Extracts the start time of the current interval.

If the start time of the current interval is less than end, it means the current interval overlaps with the previous one. In this case, the remove counter is incremented.

Otherwise, the interval does not overlap, so end is updated to the end time of the current interval (times[1]).

The first interval is always considered non-overlapping, so the loop starts from the second interval (for times in intervals[1:]).

Test Case Walkthrough:
Input:
intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]

Sorting: After sorting by end times:
intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]

Initialization:

remove = 0
end = intervals[0][1] = 2
Processing:

Second Interval [2, 3]:
        start = 2
        start >= end (2): No overlap, update end = 3.
Third Interval [3, 4]:
        start = 3
        start >= end (3): No overlap, update end = 4.
Fourth Interval [1, 3]:
        start = 1
        start < end (4): Overlap detected, increment remove = 1.
Result: The method returns 1, as one interval ([1, 3]) needs to be removed to eliminate overlaps.



Step-by-Step Sorting:
Given intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]:

The end times are: 2, 3, 4, and 3.
Sorting by these end times results in: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [3, 4]].
However, ties in end times (e.g., [2, 3] and [1, 3]) are resolved by their original order in the input list because Python's sort is stable (it preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys). Thus, the final sorted order remains:

[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
