        # Cases to handle:
        #     1. If the current interval ends before the new interval start -> add the current interval to the result
        #     2. If the current interval starts after the new interval ends -> add the new interval to the result and then add the current interval 
        #     3. If the current interval overlaps with the interval -> update the new interval to be the union and append it  



       When using the while loop:

       Explanation:
First Loop:

Adds all intervals that end before the newInterval starts.
Second Loop:

Merges all intervals that overlap with the newInterval.
Third Loop:

Adds all intervals that start after the newInterval ends.
