Why Access result[-1][1]?
Purpose of result:

The result list stores the merged intervals as you iterate through the input intervals.
The last interval in result (result[-1]) represents the most recently merged interval.
Checking for Overlap:

To determine if the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval, you compare the start of the current interval with the end of the last interval in result.
This is why result[-1][1] (the end of the last merged interval) is accessed.
