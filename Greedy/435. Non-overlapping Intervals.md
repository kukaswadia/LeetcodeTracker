- If the start time of the current interval (start) is less than end, it means the current interval overlaps with the previous one, so we increment the remove counter.
- Otherwise, update end to the end time of the current interval. 


- tracks the end time of the last non-overlapping interval. 

        intervals.sort(key = lambda x : x[1])
